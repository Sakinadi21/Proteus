# 🔢 Proteus Digital Logic Projects

This repository contains digital electronics simulations using **Proteus Design Suite**, focused on fundamental logic design topics such as **logic gates**, **multiplexers**, and **Karnaugh Map (K-Map) simplification**.

These circuits were built as part of academic lab practice and self-learning in digital logic design.
